**# Project Title**

Duo Case 8: No more toys

**## Description**

ToyHero is an app that connects people with unused or unwanted toys with families in need. It is designed to make it easy for donors to find deserving recipients who will benefit from their generosity, while also making it easier for families who are struggling to provide toys for their children.

Using ToyHero, donors can create a profile and list the toys they want to donate. They can then browse through the profiles of families in need and choose whom they would like to donate to. ToyHero also offers a rating system that helps donors and recipients rate each other based on their experience, which helps to build trust and ensure the donations are going to the right place.

The app is user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a simple interface that allows users to search for toys, view profiles, and connect with others in just a few clicks. ToyHero's mission is to promote the importance of play and bring joy to children who might not otherwise have access to toys, while also helping to reduce waste by giving unused toys a new home.

Overall, ToyHero is a platform that aims to foster generosity, kindness, and community spirit by enabling people to share unused toys with those in need.

**## Features**

1. Donation - The "Donation" feature in the app enables users to upload toys to an existing database where people would be able to list their old toys. The old toys can be donated to less fortunate families, which can't afford toys or kindergartens, which are in need of toys for the children. The donator gets a discount on new toys.

2. Live Chat - The "Communication" feature in the app allows users to communicate with each other, whether that may be with two private parties or with a kindergarten.   Both parties will be able to confirm the trade, in order for people not to take advantage of the discounts.

3. Virtual toy - The "Virtual toy" feature in the app provides users with a virtual toy, which is customizable for the users' liking. When getting a new toy, or getting rid of it, the app can scan the toy and you can have it on your phone. Minigames with it are also possible for a more entertaining and interactive experience.

4. Filter - filter according to distance
